### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my Github!

- I'm a recent Computer Science grad with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Systems, and also hold a degree in Applied Sciences with studies in Electrical Engineering and in Business. 
- I'm currently a Fellow at the AI4Good Lab in the 2022 Montreal Cohort, looking to explore the ethical implications of AI and how we can use technology for social good.
